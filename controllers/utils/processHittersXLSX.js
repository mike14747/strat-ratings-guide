// const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');

/*
I'm going to try to make this script process hitter data which is in .xlsx format instead of .csv.

That way I won't need to keep the file in both formats. All I'll need is the .xlsx file.

These seem to be the npm packages I could use (in no special order):

1. exceljs (seems to be the leading candidate)
2. node-xlsx
3. xlsx
